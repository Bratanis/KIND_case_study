# KIND_case_study

## Description


## Objective

The objective of this case study assignment is to create a development environment using
Kubernetes in Docker (KIND) and deploy a Demo application using a technology-stack of your
choice. The environment should include three namespaces (dev, test, prod). The demo
application should count clicks. A GitOps approach should be used to deploy the application.
The setup should consider latest security best-practices.


## Instructions

Using Terraform, create and deploy a multi-node KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker) cluster locally
on your device with a custom configuration (alternatively any other Kubernetes distribution
works as well):

1. Create a multi-node KIND cluster:
• Write Terraform code to set up a multi-node KIND cluster with a custom
configuration.
• Deploy your cluster via Terraform

2. Create Environment:
• Create three environments: dev, test, and prod, in your cluster.
• Make reasonable assumptions about the configuration setup and implement
as if there were three real environments.

3. Deploy Demo Application:
• Implement the demo application that counts clicks. This could be a simple
application using your preferred programming language and framework.
• Set up a GitOps pipeline using tools like Flux or Argo CD to automatically
deploy the application to the dev, test, and prod environment whenever
changes are pushed to the repository.

4. Create a security concept:
• Establish role-based access to the namespaces and the application created
• Create/document a permission concept
• Encrypt network traffic & data
• Make sure no commonly known vulnerabilities are deployed to the
productive environment
• What else can be done to protect the data assets?

5. Documentation and Presentation:
• Create a detailed documentation file (e.g., Markdown, PDF) explaining the
steps you followed to set up the environment, create environments, deploy
the demo application using GitOps and the security measures established.
• Include screenshots, code snippets, and any additional explanations to make
the documentation comprehensive.
• Prepare a presentation summarizing your work and highlighting the key
aspects of the project.

Note:
Remember to follow best practices, such as securing the environment, managing access
controls, and optimizing resource usage.
